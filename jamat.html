        Student leaders today reiterated the need for necessary reforms before
        holding elections. Chief Adviser Prof Muhammad Yunus said today that it
        may be possible to hold the next national elections at the end of 2025
        or the first half of 2026. Reacting to this timeline, top leaders of the
        Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal (JCD), the Anti-Discrimination Students'
        Movement, and the Bangladesh Students' Union demanded that essential
        reforms must be visible before the proposed elections. Nasir Uddin
        Nasir, central general secretary of the JCD, told The Daily Star, "The
        BNP has not proposed a specific timeline for the elections. However, the
        ongoing reforms must progress swiftly, and responsibility for governing
        the country should be handed over to elected representatives as soon as
        possible through elections. Reform is an ongoing process, and it should
        continue." Abdul Hannan Masud, chief organizer of the
        Anti-Discrimination Students' Movement, said, "We view the interim
        government's electoral timeline positively. Elections should be held as
        soon as possible. However, we have also demanded a clear roadmap for
        reforms before setting the election timeline. Perhaps the chief adviser
        is working on such a roadmap. This roadmap could outline the reforms to
        be implemented within this timeframe, after which the election will be
        held. If the election timeline is for late next year or early the
        following year, so be it. But reforms must precede elections. Elections
        should only follow after the reforms." Mahir Shahriar Reza, president of
        the Bangladesh Students' Union, said, "We believe that the existing
        election system in Bangladesh needs reforms. We have called for the
        introduction of a proportional representation system, depoliticising the
        Election Commission, and enacting the Election Commission Act. If the
        interim government can implement these necessary reforms and hold
        elections by 2025, we will applaud the effort." He added, "We also
        believe that prolonged rule by an unelected government is not beneficial
        for the practice of democracy in the country. Therefore, we want the
        reforms to be completed swiftly, followed by elections as soon as
        possible. Reforms should come first, followed by elections."
